openCV code


Question 1

Command #1 :
It is used to transform the image in a grey image.

Command #2 :
ret, corners = cv2.findChessboardCorners(gray, (7,6),None)
this is used to find the coordinates of the corners of the chess board, in the image grey (which is the image we got from previous command).

Command #3 :
cv2.cornerSubPix(gray,corners,(11,11),(-1,-1),criteria)
imgp.append(corners)
The first line is a call to an opencv function that makes corner coordinates more accurate.
The second line simply appends the corners, now more accurate, to a list.

# Command #4 :
cv2.drawChessboardCorners(img, (7,6), corners,ret)
This is the line that draws the chess board corners on the image.


Question 2

Lines 31 to 40 of the first code cell.


Question 3

The characteristic points will be used to track the chessboard when the image will be moving.


pyOpenGL code


Question 1

Background color to blue : glClearColor(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
Window size to 400*400 : glutInitWindowSize(400, 400)
Window name : window = glutCreateWindow(b"Hello :)")


Question 2

Once the lines are decommented, we see a white triangle ▲ ▼
The coordinates of the points are modified when we edit the parameters of the glVertex3f function.
